# ðŸ§° Installation
Make sure you have a working installation of [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/) on your system.
- If you are using Windows, graphviz dependencies are easily installable with conda, so consider using [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) or [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) instead of the plain Python distribution. Trying to install graphviz without conda is generally associated with symptoms like headaches, asphyxiation, and death.
- Linux users can install graphviz (and graphviz-dev) with their package manager (e.g. `sudo apt install -y graphviz graphviz-dev` on Ubuntu).



Then:

```bash
pip install nnviz
```
