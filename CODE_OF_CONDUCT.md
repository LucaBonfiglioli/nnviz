# No Code of Conduct

Everybody is welcome to contribute to this project regardless of their background, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion or political views or any other set of characteristics that make them unique.

I do care instead about is building something that is useful, nothing else matters. I expect you to be respectful and to be able to discuss your ideas in a constructive way, but remember that this is not a safe space and that I will not enforce any additional set of rules beyond the ones that already in place.

Please refrain from contributing to this project if you feel that you can be easily offended by the content of the code or the discussion, because nothing will be done to protect you from that unless I am forced to do so.
